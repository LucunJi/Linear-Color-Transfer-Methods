# Linear Color Transfer Methods
Here is part of the code for my CV class project. It includes implementations of several linear color transfer methods. Most of them are relatively simple compared to non-linear methods (or methods related to ML). This code is written in Python and I formulated these linear methods into similar forms for comparison.
